This is an entry in the [Fair Handeln Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/fair-handeln-hackathon-dein-social-hackathon-fur-globale-herausforderungen-tickets-56697615093).

#### Goals

Having a place to sit in the city and feeling welcome, these sound like small things but are actually quite challenging for the homeless population in Stuttgart. The privatization of the city means that although you are in a public space, you may not be welcome there.

We want to use this app as a first step to understand where there are safe and welcoming places for the homeless population within the city. We hope that it can help people find welcoming places for people to congregate and also help social workers in their efforts to reach out and help those in need of their services.

#### How it works

People can use this location-based app to find and rate areas to sit in the city. If they sit and after 2 minutes they are told to leave, their review can reflect how they felt in that space. This database of reviews will allow people to visually see within the city where they are welcome to go and where they might run into issues. This allows people to find spaces where they feel safe/ welcome to be. On the other side mapping areas of congregation allows us also to connect people to the resources and help they need within the city.

##### The future

The hope is that this can start a social discussion about inclusivity within our city. We want to create discussions about public spaces and how we should be allowed to interact within those places.
